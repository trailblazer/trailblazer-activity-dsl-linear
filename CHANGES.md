# 0.2.6

* Assign automatic `:id` to step if task is a method object.

# 0.2.5

* Patching now requires the [`:patch` option for `Subprocess`](http://2019.trailblazer.to/2.1/docs/activity.html#activity-dsl-options-patching
).

# 0.2.4

* Add a minimal API for patching nested activities. This allows customizing deeply-nested activities without changing the original.

# 0.2.3

* Add `Strategy::invoke` which is a short-cut to `TaskWrap.invoke`. It's available as class method in all three strategies.

# 0.2.2

* Fix requiring `trailblazer/activity.rb`.

# 0.2.1

* Update to `activity-0.9.1` and `context-0.2.0`.

# 0.2.0

* Update to `activity-0.9.0`.

# 0.1.9

* Fix `:extensions` merging that would override `:input` and `:output` if the `:extensions` option was given via the DSL.

# 0.1.8.

* Fix `Linear` namespacing and `require`s.

# 0.1.7

* Add `:connect_to` option to `Path()` to allow re-joining a branched activity.

# 0.1.6

* Use `activity-0.8.3`.

# 0.1.5

* Fix `:override` in combo with a missing `:id` and inheritance by moving the overriding after id generation.

# 0.1.4

* Provide default `:input` and `:output` if one of them is missing.

# 0.1.3

* Simplify `:override` handling by moving it to a later position.

# 0.1.2

* In `Strategy#to_h`, now provide a new member `:activity`, which is the actual `Activity` wrapped by the Path (or whatever) strategy.

# 0.1.1

* Raise when a step has a duplicate, already existing `:id` but is *not* a `:replace`.

# 0.1.0

* This code is extracted, refactored and heavy-metaly simplified from the original `trailblazer-activity` gem.
